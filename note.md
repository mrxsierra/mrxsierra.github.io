# Notes

- Be specific about projects you’ve worked on or managed. What was the outcome? How did you measure success?

> When in doubt, lean on the formula,

```txt
“accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z].”
```

## project structure

```sh
mkdocs.yml    # MkDocs configuration file
docs/
    index.md    # Homepage
    about.md    # About Me

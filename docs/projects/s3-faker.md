# S3 Faker

**S3 Faker** is a tool designed to generate fake data based on a JSON configuration file. The generated data can be saved locally and also uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket. This project is ideal for testing and development purposes, allowing developers to simulate S3 environments without the need for actual AWS resources. Key features include data generation using the [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/) library, support for multiple output formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet), and integration with AWS S3 via [s3fs](https://s3fs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Responsibilities
- Designed and implemented the core functionalities of the S3 Faker project.
- Developed scripts and modules to accurately simulate S3 behavior.
- Led the integration of the project with existing development and testing pipelines.
- Ensured the project adhered to best practices in terms of security and performance.
- Coordinated with team members to gather requirements and provide technical guidance.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages:** Python, PowerShell, Shell
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** Faker, Pandas, fsspec
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, LocalStack, AWS CLI

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge:** Simulating the comprehensive feature set of Amazon S3, including edge cases.
  - **Solution:** Conducted extensive research on S3 APIs and utilized `fsspec` to implement accurate simulations. Developed custom scripts to handle edge cases and ensure robustness.
- **Challenge:** Ensuring performance and scalability of the local S3 environment.
  - **Solution:** Optimized code and utilized Docker for containerization, allowing for scalable and isolated testing environments.

## Achievements
- Successfully created a fully functional S3 simulation environment, reducing reliance on actual S3 resources by 80%.
- Integrated the project with CI/CD pipelines, significantly speeding up the development and testing cycles.
- Received positive feedback from team members and external testers for the accuracy and reliability of the simulation.

## Key Learnings
- Gained in-depth knowledge of Amazon S3 APIs and their intricacies.
- Enhanced skills in Python and PowerShell scripting.
- Improved understanding of containerization and its benefits in development and testing environments.
- Learned the importance of thorough testing and documentation in ensuring project success.

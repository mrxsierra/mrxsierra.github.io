# ***Naukri Webscraper***

??? tip "Quick Summary"
    **Naukri Webscraper**  
    A Python tool that automates job searches on Naukri.com, enabling users to filter listings by skills and export structured data for analysis.

    - **Context:** `Personal Project`, `Mar 2024 – Mar 2025`, `Python`, `Selenium`, `Pandas`
    - **Role:** Sole developer—designed, implemented, tested, and documented the project
    - **Impact:** Automated skill-based job search and CSV export, validated by automated tests and real-world data extraction

## ***Overview***

Naukri Webscraper is a Python-based automation tool that scrapes job listings from Naukri.com. It extracts job titles, companies, salaries, locations, and required skills, then filters results based on user-specified skills. The project outputs structured data as CSV files for further analysis.  
The project was developed independently as a personal automation and data analysis initiative.

## ***:crossed_swords: Challenges & :star2: Solutions***

1. **Dynamic Content Loading**
    - **:crossed_swords:** Naukri.com uses JavaScript to render job listings, causing timing issues for scraping.
    - **:star2:** Used Selenium's `WebDriverWait` to ensure elements are loaded before extraction.

2. **Complex HTML Structures**
    - **:crossed_swords:** Extracting data from inconsistent or nested HTML elements.
    - **:star2:** Implemented a helper function (`get_text_or_default`) for robust text extraction.

3. **Performance Bottlenecks**
    - **:crossed_swords:** Slow scraping due to large result sets and dynamic content.
    - **:star2:** Optimized data extraction loops and used efficient Pandas operations for filtering/export.

4. **Testing Automation**
    - **:crossed_swords:** Ensuring scraping logic remains reliable as site structure changes.
    - **:star2:** Developed automated tests with `pytest` to validate core logic and catch regressions.

??? warning "***Note :*** On Site Changes and Locators"
    - The HTML structure and element locators (CSS selectors, XPaths) used in `project.py` are based on the current version of Naukri.com.  
    - If the website updates its layout or class names, you may need to update these locators in the code to restore scraping functionality.  
    - Review and adjust selectors in `project.py` if you encounter errors or missing data after a site update.

## ***Achievements***

- Automated the extraction and filtering of job listings from Naukri.com.
- Enabled skill-based filtering and CSV export for downstream analysis.
- Developed a test suite (`test_project.py`) using `pytest` to ensure reliability.
- Improved scraping robustness and error handling based on real-world site changes.

## ***Key Learnings***

- Gained practical experience with Selenium for dynamic web scraping.
- Enhanced skills in data manipulation and export using Pandas.
- Learned to write maintainable, testable code for web automation projects.
- Understood the importance of robust error handling and documentation.
- Applied `pytest` for effective and maintainable automated testing.

## ***Outcomes***

- Successfully automated job search and filtering for Naukri.com.
- Produced structured CSV datasets for analysis.
- Provided a reusable, documented tool for job seekers and data analysts.
- Ensured code reliability through automated testing with `pytest`.

    This `AI skill assessment` was generated based on the [skill-assessment-prompt.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrxsierra/mrxsierra.github.io/main/prompts/skill-assesment-prompt.md) and the provided project documentation. It is intended as an illustrative summary and should be interpreted in the context of the available code and documentation in codebase.

    ### **Strengths**

    - **Web Scraping Automation**
        - Demonstrates strong proficiency with Selenium for browser automation, including headless operation, custom user agents, and dynamic navigation (e.g., paginated scraping, handling search forms).
        - Robust handling of web elements using both CSS selectors and XPaths, with fallback/default logic for missing elements.

    - **Data Handling & Export**
        - Uses Pandas effectively for data manipulation and CSV export.
        - Implements structured data extraction with a clear schema (job title, company, salary, skills, etc.).

    - **Testing & Quality Assurance**
        - Provides automated tests using `pytest`, including fixtures, mocking user input, and live web tests (with appropriate skips for anti-bot/site change issues).
        - Tests cover both core scraping logic and utility functions.

    - **Documentation**
        - Comprehensive technical documentation (`doc.md`) and user-facing README.md with clear instructions, schema definitions, troubleshooting, and usage examples.
        - Documents function purposes, parameters, and expected behaviors in code docstrings.

    - **User Interaction & Error Handling**
        - Interactive CLI prompts for user input (search terms, page count, skill filters).
        - Handles invalid input and exceptions gracefully (e.g., `KeyboardInterrupt`, `ValueError`, missing elements).

    - **Project Structure & Packaging**
        - Uses pyproject.toml for dependency management and project metadata.
        - Separates main logic, tests, and documentation cleanly.

    ### **Areas for Growth**

    - **Security & Anti-Bot Evasion**
        - No evidence of advanced anti-bot evasion techniques (e.g., proxy rotation, CAPTCHA handling, request throttling beyond simple sleep).
        - No explicit handling of robots.txt or ethical scraping considerations in code.

    - **Scalability & Performance**
        - Scraping is single-threaded and synchronous; not optimized for large-scale or parallel scraping.
        - No batching, queuing, or distributed scraping logic.

    - **CI/CD & DevOps**
        - No evidence of CI/CD pipelines, Dockerization, or deployment automation.
        - No Makefile or scripts for environment setup/testing.

    - **Code Modularity & Extensibility**
        - All logic is in a single script (`project.py`); could benefit from modularization (e.g., separating scraping, filtering, and CLI logic).
        - No plugin or configuration system for adapting to site changes.

    - **Error Logging & Monitoring**
        - Uses print statements for errors; lacks structured logging or monitoring for production use.

    - **GUI/UX**
        - No GUI or web interface; CLI-only interaction.

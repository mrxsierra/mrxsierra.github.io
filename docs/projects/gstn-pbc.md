# **GSTN Hackathon: Predictive Binary Classification Project**

??? tip "Quick Summary"
    **GSTN Hackathon: Predictive Binary Classification**
    Developed a robust, interpretable machine learning pipeline for binary classification on anonymized GSTN data, focusing on model performance, compliance, and reproducibility.

    - **Context:** `Sep 2024`, `Python`, `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost/LightGBM`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `Jupyter`, solo project for GSTN Hackathon.
    - **Role:** Sole developer—handled all phases: EDA, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and documentation.
    - **Impact:** Achieved >97% accuracy and strong F1/MCC on imbalanced GSTN data by designing a reproducible, competition-compliant pipeline with anonymized model/code and no data leakage.

## **Overview**

This project was developed for the GSTN Hackathon, aiming to build a high-performance, interpretable binary classification model on a large, anonymized GSTN dataset. The solution strictly adheres to competition rules: all model names and parameters are anonymized/randomized, and no original or derivative datasets are included in the repository.

The workflow covers the full ML lifecycle: data integrity checks, EDA, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection (tree-based models), hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, Bayesian Optimization), cross-validation, threshold optimization, and comprehensive evaluation/reporting.

    - Final model and code anonymized for submission.
    - All data files excluded for compliance.
    - Extensive documentation and reproducibility scripts added.

??? info "**About the GSTN Hackathon**"

    The Government of India hosted an AI/ML-based Hackathon to develop predictive models for GST analytics. This initiative was designed to engage students, researchers, and professionals in designing innovative AI/ML solutions using a large, anonymized dataset of approximately 900,000 records with 21 attributes.

    ### **Key Details**

    - **Participation:** Open to Indian students, researchers, and professionals from academia, startups, or companies.
    - **Registration:** Required sign-up via Janparichay and submission of participant details.
    - **Teams:** Up to five members per team, with one team lead required. Solo participation was allowed.

    ### **Hackathon Structure**

    #### **Online Phase**

    - **Dataset Access:** Participants received anonymized, labeled datasets for training and testing.
    - **Problem Statement:**  
    Given:
    - `Dtrain`: Training data matrix (m × n)
    - `Dtest`: Test data matrix (m₁ × n)
    - `Ytrain`: Target variable for training (m × 1)
    - `Ytest`: Target variable for testing (m₁ × 1)
    - **Objective:**  
    Construct a predictive model Fθ(X) → Ypred that accurately estimates the target variable Y for new, unseen inputs X.

    #### **Workflow Steps**

    1. **Model Construction:**  
    Define a predictive function Fθ(X) parameterized by θ to map input features X to predicted outputs Ypred, capturing the relationship between features and target variable.
    2. **Training:**  
    Optimize model parameters θ by minimizing a loss function L(Y, Fθ(X)) using Dtrain. Feature engineering and selection were encouraged to enhance performance.
    3. **Testing:**  
    Apply the optimized model Fθ*(X) to Dtest to generate predictions Ypred for each input Xj.
    4. **Performance Optimization:**  
    Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC. Refine the model iteratively to improve these metrics.
    5. **Submission:**  
    Submit predicted outputs Ypred_test along with:
    - Source code (preferably on GitHub)
    - A detailed report (modeling approach, code comments, citations, evaluation metrics, and key performance indicators)

    #### **Offline Phase**

    - **Shortlisting:**  
    Top 9–15 teams were shortlisted based on initial evaluation.

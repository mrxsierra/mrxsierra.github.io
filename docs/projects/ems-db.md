# ***Examination Management System Database***

??? tip "In-Hurry Summary"
    **Examination Management System Database**
    A database designed to manage tests and examinations, covering student information, test details, questions, proctoring, and results.

    - **Context:** `Personal Project`, `Apr 2024`, `SQLite`, `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`, `DB Design`
    - **Role:** Sole Database Designer and Implementer
    - **Impact:** Enabled efficient test administration and monitoring by creating a structured database, facilitating quick data retrieval and reporting.

## ***Overview***

The Examination Management System Database project aimed to design and implement a robust database for managing tests and examinations. It covered key aspects such as student details, tests, questions, test sessions, proctors, and results. The project was initially implemented in SQLite, and later expanded into three variants: SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, each in its own directory with a consistent file structure.

!!! info "**Recent updates:**"

    - Project restructured into three dedicated directories: sqlite, mysql, and psql, each with its own schema, queries, and scripts.  
    - Added Docker-based development environments for each variant (see each directory's `compose.yaml`).  
    - Introduced Python automation scripts (`db.py`) and pytest-based test suites for all variants, using the appropriate Python database connectors.  
    - Enhanced schema with advanced triggers, views, and indexes for performance and integrity.  
    - Improved documentation and usage instructions (see [`README.md`](https://github.com/mrxsierra/ems-db/blob/main/README.md)).

## ***Goals***

The primary objectives of the project were:

- To create a robust, modular database schema to support all core processes of test administration.
- To enable efficient monitoring and analysis of test sessions, including proctoring and event auditing.
- To facilitate easy generation of reports summarizing test outcomes and student performance.
- To ensure extensibility and maintainability across multiple RDBMS backends.

## ***Responsibilities***

As the sole database designer and implementer, my responsibilities included:

- Designing the database schema for SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
- Implementing tables, relationships, triggers, views, and indexes for each variant.
- Developing and maintaining Python scripts (`db.py`) for database automation and management.
- Creating and running automated tests using pytest for all database variants.
- Setting up Docker-based development environments for consistent local and CI/CD workflows.
- Writing and maintaining comprehensive documentation.

## ***Technologies Used***

- **Languages:** SQL, Python
- **Databases:** SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **Python Connectors:**  
    - `sqlite3` (for SQLite)  
    - `mysql-connector-python` (for MySQL)  
    - `psycopg2` (for PostgreSQL)
- **Project Management:**  
    - Consistent directory structure for all variants  
    - [`README.md`](https://github.com/mrxsierra/ems-db/blob/main/README.md), `usage.md`, and `README.Docker.md` for each variant

??? abstract "Tools"

    - **Testing:** `pytest` (with `test_db.py` in each variant)
    - **Dependency Management:** `uv` (for fast Python environment setup)
    - **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose (with dedicated `Dockerfile` and `compose.yaml` in each variant)
    - **Shells/CLI:**  
        - `sqlite3` CLI (for SQLite)  
        - `mysql`/`mysqlsh` CLI (for MySQL)  
        - `psql` CLI (for PostgreSQL)
    - **Database GUIs (via Docker):**
        - `phpMyAdmin` (for MySQL)  
        - `adminer` (for PostgreSQL)
    - **Reverse Proxy:** Traefik (for local service routing in Docker)
    - **Documentation:** Markdown, Mermaid (for ER diagrams)

    > ***Note ***: All development and testing environments are containerized for consistency and reproducibility.

## ***Process***

The project followed a structured approach:

1. **Conceptual Design:** Identified entities and relationships required for the examination system.
2. **Logical Design:** Translated the conceptual design into detailed schemas for each RDBMS.
3. **Physical Design:** Implemented the schema, triggers, indexes, and views in each database.
4. **Testing:** Inserted sample data and ran automated queries and tests to validate the design and performance.
5. **Optimization:** Added indexes and views to improve query performance and usability.
6. **Automation:** Developed Python-based scripts and test suites for all variants.
7. **Containerization:** Provided Docker Compose files for reproducible development environments.

    This `AI skill assessment` was generated based on the [skill-assessment-prompt.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrxsierra/mrxsierra.github.io/main/prompts/skill-assesment-prompt.md) and the provided project documentation. It is intended as an illustrative summary and should be interpreted in the context of the available code and documentation in codebase.

    ### **Strengths**

    - **Relational Database Design:**  
        - Strong understanding of relational modeling, normalization, and entity relationships.
        - Consistent schema design across **SQLite**, **MySQL**, and **PostgreSQL**, with appropriate use of constraints, foreign keys, and indexes.
        - Advanced use of triggers for automation (e.g., scoring, feedback, session/event management).

    - **SQL Proficiency:**  
        - Proficient in writing complex SQL queries, views, and batch scripts for all three RDBMS.
        - Good use of views to abstract and simplify reporting and analytics.

    - **Python Automation & Testing:**  
        - Automated database setup and validation using Python (`db.py` scripts).
        - Pytest-based test suites for each variant, using correct connectors (`sqlite3`, `mysql-connector-python`, `psycopg2`).
        - Use of fixtures and in-memory databases for efficient, isolated testing.

    - **DevOps & Environment Management:**  
        - Docker and Docker Compose used for reproducible development environments for each database variant.
        - Clear, modular directory structure and environment setup instructions.
        - Use of uv for Python dependency management.

    - **Documentation:**  
        - Well-structured Markdown documentation, usage guides, and ER diagrams.
        - Clear separation of concerns and instructions for each database backend.

    ### **Areas for Growth**

    - **CI/CD Integration:**  
        - No current implementation of automated CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
        - Adding automated build/test on push would further professionalize the workflow.

    - **GUI/UX Tools:**  
        - No use of GUI database tools (e.g., DB Browser for SQLite) in workflow; all interactions are CLI or script-based.
        - Could consider adding optional GUI instructions for broader accessibility.

    - **Security & Advanced Features:**  
        - No implementation of advanced security (role-based access, encryption, etc.).
        - No support for subjective question types or broader educational/administrative features.

    - **Scalability & Production Readiness:**  
        - Focus is on schema and logic, not on production deployment, backup, or scaling strategies.

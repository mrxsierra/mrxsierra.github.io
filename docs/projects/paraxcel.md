# Paraxcel

??? tip "Quick Summary"
    **Paraxcel**
    A lightweight, local-first Python desktop application using Tkinter to convert Microsoft Word DOCX files containing multiple-choice questions into structured Excel spreadsheets.

    - **Context:** `Python`, `Tkinter`, `Pandas`, `Pydantic`, `python-docx`, `Solo Project`, `Feb-Mar 2025`
    - **Role:** Sole developer responsible for design, implementation, testing, documentation, and packaging of the application.
    - **Impact:** Created a tool that automates the extraction of questions and answers from DOCX files, reducing manual data entry time for educators and content creators, by implementing parsing logic with `python-docx` and structuring output with `pandas`.

## Overview

Paraxcel is a Python desktop application built with Tkinter that addresses the need for converting multiple-choice questions from DOCX files into an organized Excel format, it targets educators, content creators, and assessment professionals who need to manage question banks efficiently. The application provides a simple graphical user interface for file selection and conversion, running entirely locally.

## Goals

The primary goals for the Paraxcel project were:

- To automate the tedious and time-consuming manual process of extracting multiple-choice questions and their corresponding answers from Microsoft Word documents.
- To structure the extracted data into a usable and organized Excel format.
- To create a simple, reliable, and accessible desktop tool for educators and content creators.

## Responsibilities

- Designed the application architecture, including module separation (`docx_parser`, `excel_writer`, `model`, `para_utility`, `interface`) for maintainability and scalability.
- Implemented robust `DOCX` parsing using `python-docx` to accurately extract `questions`, `answer options`, and identify the `correct answer` based on formatting (`color/highlight`).
- Utilized pandas to structure extracted data into a standardized, clean format, enabling reliable export to `.xlsx` files.
- Built a user-friendly graphical interface with `Tkinter`, enabling users to easily select input files/folders and initiate the conversion process.
- Integrated Pydantic for rigorous data validation of extracted question data, ensuring data integrity before export.
- Created essential utility functions (`para_utility.py`) for text cleaning, format handling, and precise answer detection.
- Authored comprehensive technical (`doc.md`) and user (`README.md`) documentation.
- Packaged the application into a standalone executable using `PyInstaller` for straightforward distribution and use on Windows.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages:** Python
- **GUI:** Tkinter (Standard Python library) - For building the desktop graphical interface.
- **DOCX Parsing:** `python-docx` - For reading and analyzing `.docx` file content.
- **Data Handling & Excel Export:** `pandas` - For structuring the extracted data and writing to `.xlsx` files.
- **Data Validation:** `Pydantic` - For validating the structure and types of extracted question data.
- **Documentation:** `Markdown` - For `README.md` and `doc.md`.

??? abstract "Tools"
    - **Version Control:** Git
    - **Packaging:** PyInstaller - For creating the standalone executable.
    - **Development Environment:** VS Code

## Process

The development process involved identifying the need for a simple DOCX-to-Excel conversion tool for MCQs and followed a structured approach focused on modularity and ease of use.

1. **Requirement Gathering**: Defined the core functionality: parse DOCX files containing questions followed by four options and export them to Excel, including support for detecting marked answers.
2. **Technology Stack Selection**: Chose libraries (`python-docx`, `pandas`, `Tkinter`, `Pydantic`) best suited for the task, balancing functionality with ease of deployment (local-first, standard libraries).
3. **Modular Implementation**: Developed each component (`parsing`, `writing`, `GUI`, `validation`) as a distinct module.
4. **Testing & Refinement**: Used sample files to rigorously test parsing accuracy and output format.
5. **Documentation**: Created user and technical guides to support adoption and understanding.
6. **Packaging**: Prepared the application for distribution as a single executable.

## :crossed_swords: Challenges & :star2: Solutions

1. **Handling Varied DOCX Formatting**
    - :crossed_swords: Parsing semi-structured DOCX files presented challenges due to inconsistencies in formatting, numbering, and spacing. Reliably detecting the correct answer based on subtle formatting like font color or highlighting was a key challenge.
    - :star2: Developed flexible parsing logic (`parse_para`) designed to accommodate common variations. Implemented specialized utility functions (`remove_prefix`, `find_marked_answer`) that leverage python-docx's capabilities to accurately identify marked answers by inspecting run-level formatting properties. Documented input format expectations clearly to guide users.

2. **Ensuring Data Quality and Consistency**
    - :crossed_swords: Extracting data from a semi-structured format like DOCX risked incomplete or malformed records before export.
    - :star2: Integrated Pydantic models (`Question`) to enforce a strict schema for extracted data. This validation step acts as a safeguard, ensuring that only correctly structured and typed data proceeds to the `Excel` export, preventing errors and ensuring reliable output.

3. **Creating an Accessible Tool for Non-Technical Users**
    - :crossed_swords: The goal was a tool usable by educators without programming knowledge, requiring a simple interface and easy installation.
    - :star2: Built a straightforward and intuitive GUI using Tkinter, Python's standard library, minimizing external dependencies. Used `PyInstaller` to bundle the application and all its dependencies into a single, easy-to-distribute executable (`paraxcel.exe`), significantly lowering the barrier to entry for end-users.

## Achievements

- Developed and launched Paraxcel, a functional desktop application, automating the conversion of MCQs from DOCX to a structured Excel format.
- Implemented advanced parsing features, including the ability to detect correct answers based on font color or highlighting within the DOCX file.
- Incorporated basic text formatting handling (superscript/subscript) during extraction for improved data fidelity.
- Provided clear, user-focused documentation (`README.md`) and technical insights (`doc.md`).
- Packaged the application into a convenient standalone executable using PyInstaller, simplifying deployment and usage.

> **Impact**: Enabled educators and content creators to save significant time and effort (quantified by reduced manual data entry hours) previously spent on manual data entry.

## Key Learnings

- Gained practical experience using the `python-docx` library to parse the structure and formatting of Word documents programmatically.
- Developed skills in building simple desktop GUIs with Python's built-in `Tkinter` library.
- Applied `Pydantic` for robust data validation in a data processing pipeline.
- Utilized `pandas` for efficient data structuring and exporting to Excel formats.
- Learned the process of packaging Python applications into standalone executables using `PyInstaller`, including handling dependencies and data files.
- Understood the challenges and importance of defining clear input format expectations when parsing semi-structured documents like DOCX.

## Outcomes

- A working, local-first desktop application (`paraxcel.exe`) capable of converting DOCX files (containing questions and 4 options) into structured Excel (`.xlsx`) files.
- Source code is available on GitHub, along with documentation and sample files.
- A video demonstration showcasing the application's functionality.
